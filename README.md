# BTree-part2
##### This is a class project which builds an order 3 B-tree that uses strategy pattern to change the sorting algorithm. The B-tree object extends the Java Collection class and stores students ordered by the sorting stratigies. 
##### The internal iterator uses in-order traversal, while the external iterator traverses the tree in a reverse order
##### You can edit and run the main method in BTreeApplication.java to see the output of different sorting strategies and iterators.
##### You can inistantiate new bTree object and pass one of the two sorting strategies to it such as sort by student name in alphabetical order or by student ID.
##### The bTree has an internal iterator as well as an external iterator.
##### Students on probabion are students whose GPA is lower than 3.0
